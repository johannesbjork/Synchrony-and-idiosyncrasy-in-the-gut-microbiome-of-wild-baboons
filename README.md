Code for the project: **Synchrony and idiosyncrasy in the gut microbiome of wild primates**

*hierarchical_smooths.Rmd* contains code to reproduce all plots showing dynamics in terms of smooth functions over time.
*time_decay.Rmd* contains code to reproduce all plots showing patterns of time-decay in community similarity with increasing lags of time. 

*gams.Rmd* contains code to fit all GAMs.
*gams_sanity_checks.Rmd* contains code for a series of sanity check for the GAMs; especially checks to show that the increase in deviance explained is not an artifact from data aggregation or increasing model complexity.
