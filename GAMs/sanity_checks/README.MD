# The effect of model complexity on deviance explained 

In many settings, increasing the complexity of a model (i.e., degrees of freedom) also increases variance or deviance explained, even if additional model parameters do not improve model fit. To ensure that this explanation does not account for our observation that the hierarchical models explain more deviance than single level models (e.g., P+G versus P), we performed three analyses. In the first and second analysis, we randomized social group membership and host identity, including group and host-level covariates (see below for more information). In the third analysis, we performed a simulation to investigate the effect of model complexity on deviance explained.

**1. Randomize social group membership and host identity**

We randomize **(i)** social group membership while keeping samples from the same host intact, and **(ii)** host identity while keeping social group, season and hydrological year intact. For both **(i)** and **(ii)** we also randomize social group and host level predictor variables, respectively. We fit these randomized group and host labels to model P+G+H.

**2. Simulation**

We simulated data with a strong population-level effect, but with very similar average functional responses among social groups. We simulated data from 4 hosts, each with 100 samples divided into two social groups. We fit two models mimicking model P and model P+G.
