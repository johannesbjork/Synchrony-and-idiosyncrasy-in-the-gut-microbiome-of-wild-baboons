# The effect of model complexity on deviance explained 

**1. Randomize social group membership and host identity**

We randomize **(i)** social group membership while keeping samples from the same host intact, and **(ii)** host identity while keeping social group, season and hydrological year intact. For both **(i)** and **(ii)** we also randomize social group and host level predictor variables, respectively. We fit these randomized group and host labels to model P+G+H.

**2. Simulation**

We simulated data with a strong population-level effect, but with very similar average functional responses among social groups. We simulated data from 4 hosts, each with 100 samples divided into two social groups. We fit two models mimicking model P and model P+G.
